**Observed result:**

```text
192.232.216.135
```

**Security relevance:**

IP resolution provides information about the network location associated with a web service and may support further authorized infrastructure analysis.

---

### 🔹 4.1.4 cURL

The following HTTP-header inspection technique was used:

```bash
curl -I networkwalks.com
```

The response provided additional information about the web application and exposed the following REST API endpoint:

```text
/wp-json/
```

**Security relevance:**

HTTP response information can assist with technology fingerprinting and further authorized enumeration.

---

### 🔹 4.1.5 Wafw00f

Wafw00f was used to determine whether a Web Application Firewall was protecting the target.

- Service records
- DNS-related information

**Security relevance:**

DNS information can help create a broader understanding of an organization's publicly exposed infrastructure.

---

# 🛡️ 4.2 Network Scanning with Zenmap

The second practical activity focused on **network discovery using Zenmap**.

The objective was to:

- Identify the local IP address
- Determine the local subnet
- Discover active hosts
- Identify IP addresses
- Identify MAC addresses
- Generate a network topology

The Windows `ipconfig` command was first used to identify the local network configuration.

The identified subnet was then entered into Zenmap.

### 🔍 Scan Type

```text
Ping Scan
```

The scan was used to identify active devices on the local network.

### Example Hosts Identified

```text
10.0.0.1
10.0.0.4
10.0.0.19
10.0.0.5
```

The practical example also identified associated MAC addresses.

After completing the scan, the **Topology** section in Zenmap was used to visualize the discovered network.

The topology legend was enabled and the resulting network topology was saved in PDF format as required by the practical exercise.

> **Important:** The addresses above represent the example results supplied for the practical. When submitting the final assessment, they should be replaced with the actual results from my authorized local network.

---

# 🛡️ 5. Risk Analysis & Impact

The following observations were identified during the footprinting and network discovery activities.

| # | 🔎 Finding | 📊 Evidence / Observation | ⚠️ Potential Impact | Risk |
|---:|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Web technology information exposed | WhatWeb identified WordPress and WP Download Manager | Could assist technology fingerprinting and further security review | 🟠 **Medium** |
| 2 | Server IP identifiable | Nslookup resolved the domain to `192.232.216.135` | Provides information about the network location of the web service | 🟢 **Low** |
| 3 | HTTP technical information exposed | curl returned HTTP headers and exposed `/wp-json/` | May assist fingerprinting and further enumeration | 🟢 **Low** |
| 4 | WAF technology identifiable | Wafw00f identified ModSecurity | Reveals information about the web application's defensive architecture | 🟢 **Low** |
| 5 | DNS infrastructure information exposed | DNSRecon identified DNS, mail and service records | Can assist in building an infrastructure profile | 🟠 **Medium** |
| 6 | Multiple live hosts visible | Zenmap identified four hosts in the example network | Unknown devices may represent unauthorized or unmanaged assets | 🟠 **Medium** |

### Risk Rating Key

| Indicator | Severity |
|---|---|
| 🔴 | **Critical** |
| 🟠 | **Medium** |
| 🟢 | **Low** |

> **Important Assessment Note:**  
> These findings represent observations from reconnaissance and network discovery activities. They are **not confirmed vulnerabilities**.

No exploitation or vulnerability validation was performed during these two modules.

The presence of a software version, IP address, DNS record, or HTTP endpoint does not by itself prove that a system is vulnerable.

Additional authorized security testing would be required to validate any suspected vulnerability.

---

# 🛡️ 6. Recommendations

Based on the observations collected during the assessment, the following security improvements are recommended.

### 1️⃣ Review Publicly Exposed Technology Information

Organizations should regularly review publicly exposed information relating to their CMS platforms, plugins, frameworks, and web technologies.

### 2️⃣ Maintain Updated Software

CMS platforms, plugins, frameworks, and other technologies should be regularly updated and monitored against current security advisories.

### 3️⃣ Review HTTP Response Headers

HTTP response headers should be reviewed to determine whether unnecessary technical information is being exposed.

### 4️⃣ Review DNS Records

DNS records should be periodically reviewed to ensure that only required information and services are publicly exposed.

### 5️⃣ Properly Configure & Monitor the WAF

The Web Application Firewall should remain enabled, properly configured, monitored, and regularly tuned according to the organization's security requirements.

### 6️⃣ Perform Regular Internal Network Discovery

Organizations should periodically scan their authorized internal networks to identify active devices and maintain visibility of their infrastructure.

### 7️⃣ Investigate Unknown Devices

Unexpected devices identified during network discovery should be investigated and verified.

### 8️⃣ Maintain Network Documentation

Network topology, IP addresses, devices, and infrastructure documentation should be maintained and updated regularly.

### 9️⃣ Perform Security Testing Within an Authorized Scope

All reconnaissance, scanning, enumeration, and security testing should be performed only against systems and networks where appropriate authorization has been obtained.

# 🛡️ 9. Conclusion

During **Week 2 of my Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking internship at Networkwalks**, I completed practical activities covering **reconnaissance, footprinting, and network scanning**.

During the footprinting phase, I used multiple Kali Linux tools to collect and analyze publicly observable information about the target domain.

I learned how:

```text
WHOIS       → Domain information
WhatWeb     → Web technology fingerprinting
Nslookup    → DNS / IP resolution
cURL        → HTTP header inspection
Wafw00f     → WAF identification
DNSRecon    → DNS enumeration
```

During the network scanning phase, I used **Zenmap** to discover active hosts within my authorized local network environment and examine IP, MAC address, and topology information.

The exercises reinforced an important cybersecurity principle:

> **Effective security testing begins with understanding the environment.**

I also learned the importance of documenting security findings professionally by clearly explaining:

```text
What was performed
        ↓
What was discovered
        ↓
Why it matters
        ↓
What risk it may create
        ↓
How the risk can be reduced
```

Most importantly, these exercises reinforced the requirement that reconnaissance and scanning must always be conducted within an **authorized scope**.

This project represents another step in my development as a cybersecurity professional and contributes to my ongoing practical experience in **ethical hacking, network security, reconnaissance, and security assessment**.
